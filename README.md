# Fight Arena

## Combat mechanics: 
### Based on the stamina of your character, you will have a maximum number of Rounds and Turns unless your character dies first. Same goes for the NPC.

### At the beginning of each round, you will choose combat moves equal to the amount of Turns your character's stamina allots. 

### At the end of each turn you will deal or take damage.
